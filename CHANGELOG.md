All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added
- **Human-in-the-loop confirmation for destructive actions**, via MCP [elicitation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/client/elicitation). When the connected client supports elicitation, `delete_resource`, `exec_in_pod`, and `apply_manifest` now pause and ask the **human** to approve the exact action before it runs — a model can echo a confirmation string, but it cannot approve a prompt shown to the user. Clients that don't advertise elicitation fall back to the existing `*_ALLOW_*` flag gate, so enabling this is never *more* permissive than before.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- Require **Node 22** (previously Node 20); the updated dependency tree needs Node ≥ 22.19. CI and release workflows, the Dockerfile base image, and `engines` were updated.
- Bump `@kubernetes/client-node` → ^2.0.0, `zod` → ^4, `typescript` → ^7, and `@types/node` → ^26 (Dependabot group). Update the `apply_manifest` input schema to `z.record(z.string(), z.any())` for zod 4.
- Bump the test runner `vitest` to ^5.0.0.

### Security
- Refresh the dependency tree to clear the moderate `hono` and `qs` advisories (transitive via the MCP SDK's HTTP transport, unused by this stdio server) and the `vitest` advisory; `npm audit` now reports **0 vulnerabilities**.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-30

### Changed
- Bump `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to ^1.30.0 to clear known dependency advisories flagged by supply-chain scanners.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- MCP **tool annotations** on every tool (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`,
  `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`), derived from each tool's access
  capability. Hosts can now reason about a tool's safety from structured
  metadata instead of parsing the description — read tools are advertised as
  read-only and non-destructive, admin/destructive tools as mutating.
- A test that keeps the annotations consistent with each tool's capability.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial release.
